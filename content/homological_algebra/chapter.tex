As we have attempted to communicate in
\cref{chap_abelian_categories}, abelian categories are such a
bountiful abstraction because they grant a category the power of
exact sequences.
At the same time, exactness is not a foregone conclusion for any
sequence of morphisms arising in practice, and a mathematically
interesting problem in its own right is to attempt to understand `how
far' from exactness a sequence is.
This is the fundamental problem studied in \emph{homological
algebra}, which has proved to be an irreplaceable technical tool in
the modern practice of algebraic geometry, algebraic topology and a
whole host of branches of mathematics.

The goal of this chapter is to develop the required background in
this area needed to delve into the derived category of an abelian
category in \cref{chap_derived_categories}, following \cite{weibel}.
Homological algebra is a topic best served with a more tangible
motivating application in mind, and this is traditionally sourced
from algebraic topology.
Since such material is outside of the scope of this thesis, we will
continue to tether our intuitions to $\Mod{R}$.

In all that follows, $\abcat{A}$ and $\abcat{B}$ are always abelian categories.
