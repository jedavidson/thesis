\chapter{Abelian categories}
\label{chap_abelian_categories}

In this first chapter, we introduce \emph{abelian categories}, a
class that captures some essential properties of categories such as
$\Ab$ and $\Mod{R}$.
We will mostly follow
\cite{category_theory_for_the_working_mathematician, freyd_abelian_categories}.
The origin of abelian categories in contemporary form is
Grothendieck's influential \emph{T\={o}hoku paper} of 1957, though
this work is predated by Buchsbaum's similar notion of an \emph{exact
category} (which now means something else entirely) defined two years prior.

The main selling point of working with abelian categories is that
they are endowed with enough structure to make sense of exact
sequences of morphisms, and in a way that is sufficiently general
enough to describe many categories arising in practice.
Owing to this flexibility, they are now a foundational abstraction in
several branches of modern algebra, especially those areas which this
thesis deals in.
