\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

My greatest thanks must go to my supervisor, Professor Daniel Chan,
for introducing me to this topic and for all of his support over the past year.
For better or worse, algebraic geometry and contemporary algebra writ
large are very technical fields, and it can be hard to find your feet at times.
This thesis would be nothing without your patience in guiding me
along and for enduring my many questions.

I am very fortunate to have met the people I have met in my five
years here at UNSW, especially those for whom the word `lemon' means
more than an innocuous fruit.
To the other honours and postgraduate students I have spent time with
this year, thank you for being a great bunch all around.

I am exceedingly grateful to Lyria Bennett Moses and Daniel Moses for
their generosity in financially supporting me this year by way of the
Moses Honours Year Scholarship.
In a year with a number of surprises, this was surely the most
unexpected of all!

Finally, I would be remiss to not acknowledge my parents.
As you are uniquely positioned to know, it does not seem all that
long ago that my relationship with mathematics was strained, and
viewed in the context of this it would seem quite unlikely that I
would eventually go on to do something like this.
Much has changed in order for that to happen, but what remains
constant is your unending support, and for that I owe a debt far
beyond what words can express.
