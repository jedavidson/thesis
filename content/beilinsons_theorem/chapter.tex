\chapter{Beilinson's theorem for $\proj{1}$}
\label{chap_beilinsons_theorem}

It is now time to deliver on the main goal of this thesis, that being
to state and prove \emph{Beilinson's theorem} for $\proj{1}$.
We will follow the methods of \emph{tilting theory}, ultimately
realising this result as a consequence of the existence of a certain
\emph{tilting bundle} in $\Coh(\proj{1})$.
This will bring to bear the considerable arsenal of mathematical
tools we have worked hard to assemble so far.
