\chapter*{Abstract}

A celebrated theorem of Beilinson in the short note \cite{beilinson}
establishes an equivalence of derived categories between the coherent
sheaves on $\proj{n}$ and modules over certain finite dimensional algebras.
We give a gentle introduction to this result in the case of
$\proj{1}$ using the more modern machinery of tilting theory.
In particular, we ultimately show that this derived equivalence links
the geometry of $\proj{1}$ to the representation theory of the
Kronecker quiver, demonstrating a fruitful connection between the
fields of algebraic geometry and representation theory.
