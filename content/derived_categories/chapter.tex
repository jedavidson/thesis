\chapter{Derived categories}
\label{chap_derived_categories}

We are now sufficiently prepared to establish the notion of the
\emph{derived category}, following the texts \cite{weibel,
huybrechts, gelfand_and_manin}.
At its core, this technical apparatus provides a more natural
computational setting for the study of homological algebra than the
category of cochain complexes.
In comparison to the level of abstractions we have encountered thus
far, the material in this chapter will at times become rather
technical, so it will be beneficial to first outline the main
motivations for derived categories and collect some desiderata to hold onto.

The central conceit is that from a computational standpoint, it is
convenient to be able to treat complexes that have the same
cohomology (i.e.\ those which are quasi-isomorphic, homotopy
equivalent or both) as if they are isomorphic.
Indeed, we have seen a concrete instance of this already in
\cref{sect_classical_derfunc}, which suggests that we should be able
to freely interchange the objects of an abelian category with any of
its resolutions when computing derived functors.
At the same time, a complex is more than just its cohomology, and so
on the face of it, associating complexes to a mathematical object of
interest rather than just its cohomology leads to a more fruitful
source of algebraic invariants.
In much the same way, the historical viewpoint of Grothendieck was
that the suite of classical derived functors should be the
information extracted from a single derived functor existing at the
level of complexes in the derived category.

In all that follows, $\abcat{A}$ will be an abelian category.
