\chapter{The coherent sheaf theory of $\proj{1}$}
\label{chap_coh_sheaf_theory_of_p1}

With our abstract preliminaries from the previous chapters all set
up, this chapter marks a change of course, as we will now move into
the realm of algebraic geometry and ultimately study the
\emph{coherent sheaves} on the projective line and some rudimentary
coherent sheaf cohomology.
These sheaves are characterised by their connection to modules, which
make them amenable to the techniques of commutative algebra.
Moreover, they are sufficiently restrictive as a type of sheaf to be
tractable to study while also encompassing many examples frequently
arising in practice.

% In essence, the property of a sheaf being coherent assumes a
% similar role to that of a module being finitely generated, and
% indeed we shall see that coherent sheaves on $\aff{1}$ and
% $\proj{1}$ have a convenient and rather direct connection to modules.
% (at least over `well-behaved' rings).

We will present a heavily specialised treatment that is sufficient to
obtain a working definition for $\proj{1}$.
Our main source for this are the set of mini-lectures
\cite{users_guide_to_coh_sheaves, cohom_of_coh_sheaves}.
This treatment is neither novel nor particularly unusual beyond this,
as we will also integrate material from the trio of sources
\cite{chen_and_krause, team_edward, crawley} that view these sheaves
in much the same way.

In all that follows, we fix an algebraically closed field $k$.
